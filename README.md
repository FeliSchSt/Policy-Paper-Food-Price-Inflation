# Policy-Paper-Food-Price-Inflation
During my internship at the Germany Institute for Global and Area Studies (June-August 2021) I wrote
this draft for a policy paper due to my personal interest in topics related to food security. It was internally presented in front of researchers of the institute, but not officially published. The paper is based on a literature review.
